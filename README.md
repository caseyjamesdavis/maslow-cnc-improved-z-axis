### This repo details my efforts towards improving the Z-axis of a [Maslow CNC Machine](https://www.maslowcnc.com/)

I purchased my Maslow kit from [MAKER MADE](https://makermade.com/).  

I decided to use the OPENBUILDS [C-Beam Linear Actuator](https://openbuildspartstore.com/c-beam-linear-actuator-bundle/) as the basis for my Z-axis.  There is no need to purchase the stepper motor as it will not work with the Maslow.

This only works with the Rigid R2911 router.

Below are the three main pieces that need to be 3D printed.  
 


**Router Clamp** - this connects the router to the carriage of the linear actuator

**Motor Mount** - this connects the existing Z-axis motor to the linear actuator

**Brace** - this helps keep the z-axis perpendicular to the board

The CAD data supplied can be opened with FreeCAD V0.19 and the Assembly 4 Workbench.

Notes:
* Effective pitch of the new lead screw is 8[mm] (2mm pitch x 4 starts)


To do:
* Add dust collection panels
* trim actual to more reasonable length
